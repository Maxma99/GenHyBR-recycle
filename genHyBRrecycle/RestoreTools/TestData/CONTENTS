This directory contains a variety of test data.  Notation
is as follows:

  x_true : denotes the true image, if it is known.
  PSF    : image of the point spread function.  If spatially variant blur,
           then this is a cell array containing several PSFs.
  b      : blurred and noisy image.
  b_true : noise free blurred image, if it is known.
  A      : a matrix that can be a MATLAB full or sparse matrix, or a 
           psfMatrix object
  options: a structure, built using IRset.m, that can be used to set certain
           optional input values.
  info   : a structure that contains information about the iteration
           

Following is some specific information about the data files:

  * Text.mat
    Contains data of some text.  The true image is in Matlab's image
    processing toolbox.  The PSF was generated using psfGauss.m,
    and is therefore a separable Gaussian blur.  This means one can
    use direct methods such as TSVD to restore the image.

  * satellite.mat
    This is the famous satellite data used as test data by many
    researchers in image processing.  The data came originally from the
    Air Force Research Laboratory as part of a simulation study of
    numerical methods for post processing images taken through atmospheric
    turbulence. The true image is known.

  * star_cluster.mat 
    This is data comes from the original Hubble Space Telescope; see
    http://www.stsci.edu/resources/  for more information and other data.
    The data is not ill-conditioned, but it is a good example of a 
    spatially variant blur.  One can use 1, 4, or 25 PSFs to restore
    the image.  The true image is known.

  * psfGauss.m
    The function psfGauss.m can be used to create a Gaussian PSF.
    Use "help psfGauss" for more information.

  * Three examples of spatially invariant Gaussian blurs, using the PSF
    given in equation (8) in [1], and with the following parameters:

    GaussianBlur440.mat corresponds to the case alpha_1 = alpha_2 = 4 and rho = 0.
    GaussianBlur420.mat corresponds to the case alpha_1 = 4, alpha_2 = 2 and rho = 0.
    GaussianBlur422.mat corresponds to the case alpha_1 = 4, alpha_2 = 2 and rho = 2.

  * Three examples of blurring caused by atmospheric turbulences. The PSF
    is described by equation (9) in [1], and wavefronts were created with three
    different values of d/r_0. Specifically,

    AtmosphericBlur10 corresponds to d/r_0 = 10.
    AtmosphericBlur30 corresponds to d/r_0 = 30.
    AtmosphericBlur50 corresponds to d/r_0 = 50.

  * Spatially variant Gaussian blur, using the PSF given by equation (10) in [1]:

    VariantGaussianBlur1.mat uses alpha_1(s) = 3/4(3|s| + 1) and alpha_2(t) = 3/4(3|t| + 1).
    VariantGaussianBlur2.mat uses alpha_1(s) = 3/4(-3|s| + 1) and alpha_2(t) = 3/4(-3|t| + 1).
    VariantGaussianBlur3.mat uses alpha_1(s) = 3 - t/2 and alpha_2(t) = 3 - t/2.

    For each of these we generated 49 PSFs in a 7 x 7 region partitioning 
    of the image domain. Thus, when this data is loaded into MATLAB, PSF
    and center will be cell arrays.

  * Spatially variant motion blur:
    
    VariantMotionBlur_small.mat contains data for the small motion simulation.
    VariantMotionBlur_medium.mat contains data for the medium motion simulation.
    VariantMotionBlur_large.mat contains data for the large motion simulation.
